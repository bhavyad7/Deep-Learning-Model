# Deep-Learning-Model

Optimize and Deploy a Deep Learning model for the Prediction of a Future Sequence of Data

The scientific focus will be on disruption research, which aims to develop methods for the safe, rapid shutdown of high-power tokamak plasmas. The Ohmically heated circular limiter tokamak ADITYA (R0 = 75 cm, a = 25 cm) has been upgraded to a tokamak named the ADITYA Upgrade (ADITYA-U) with an open diverter configuration. The main goal of ADITYA-U is to carry out dedicated experiments including disruption prediction, and mitigation studies. The ability of deep learning methods to learn from such complex data makes them applicable to the task of forecasting disruptions. The proposed method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based and classical machine-learning approaches. We need to optimize and deploy a multi-dimensional, time-dependent data-driven model on selected hardware.

Objective: Get the experimental data from the Aditya server which can feed it as a model hyperparameter. This requires manual and automatic classification approaches. The model will be trained based on the given input data. The developed model will be applied to the simulated or real environment.

Deliverables: Trained model should be applied to the real-time server with a simulated or real-time server to predict the event before happening. Prediction of future sequence data needs to be optimized further to achieve higher accuracy for deployment on embedded hardware.
